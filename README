xfce4-dict-plugin - A plugin to query a Dict server

With this plugin you can query a dictionary server(see RFC 2229) to search for the
translation or explanation of a word. You can also choose a dictionary offered by the
server to improve your search results.
There are two special dictionaries:
* - use this dictionary to search in all available dictionaries on the server
! - use this dictionary to search in all available dictionaries on the server but
    stop searching after the first match.

You can also easily select a word in an email or on a webpage and drag it onto the dict
icon in your panel, then the plugin begins to search and shows you the results.

This plugin was mainly tested with the server "dict.org" but should work with any other
servers which implement the DICT protocol defined in RFC 2229.

ToDo:
- support user authentification
- keep dictionary list in memory
- support the MATCH command
