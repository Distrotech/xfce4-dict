xfce4-dict-plugin - A plugin to query a Dict server and other dictionary sources

With this plugin you can query a dictionary server(see RFC 2229) to search for the
translation or explanation of a word. You can also choose a dictionary offered by the
server to improve your search results.
There are two special dictionaries:
* - use this dictionary to search in all available dictionaries on the server
! - use this dictionary to search in all available dictionaries on the server but
    stop searching after the first match.

You can also easily select a word in an email or on a webpage and drag it onto the dict
icon in your panel, then the plugin begins to search and shows you the results.

This plugin was mainly tested with the server "dict.org" but should work with any other
servers which implement the DICT protocol defined in RFC 2229.

Searching web-based dictionary services like dict.leo.org or other ones is also supported
by passing the search word as a URL argument and opening the URL in your webbrowser. The URL
can be configured in the preferences dialog.

It is also possible to verify the spelling of word using aspell. To get this working you need
to have the aspell binary in your binary search path and at least one dictionary working. If you
have multiple aspell dictionaries installed, you can select the one to use in the preferences
dialog.

Together with the plugin itself, a little tool named "xfce4-popup-dict" is installed which can
be used to open the plugin's main window from the command line or from any other program.
It can also be used to bind the dict plugin actions to a keyboard shortcut. You can add a new
keyboard command with the Keyboard settings plugin in Xfce's settings manager and assign
xfce4-popup-dict as the action command.
It accepts the arguments -t and --text-field to grab the focus to the text entry field in the
panel (if shown, it does nothing if not). If called without any arguments, it simply shows the
plugin's main window.
To get a list of available command line options you can also pass -h and --help as command line
options.
